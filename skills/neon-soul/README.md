## What is a Soul Document?

A **soul document** is a compressed representation of an AI agent's identity, values, and behavioral principles. Instead of loading thousands of memory tokens at each conversation start, agents load a small soul file (~100-500 tokens) that captures their core essence with full provenance tracking back to the original memories.

---

## The Core Insight

> **Compression is a multiplier, not minimization.**
>
> Compression happens at the axiom layer: thousands of memory tokens distill to 15-25 core axioms (~7:1 ratio). The axiom store grows denser over time.

The output format is separate from compression:
- **Notation format**: Compact CJK/emoji bullets (~100 tokens) - for storage and debugging
- **Prose format**: Inhabitable language (~200-500 words) - for agents to embody

Both formats derive from the same compressed axiom layer. Prose is larger but usable; the underlying compression benefit is preserved.

Current AI identity systems are black boxes. The agent's personality changes, but users don't know why.

NEON-SOUL provides:
- **Full provenance tracking**: Every axiom traces back to exact source lines in memory files
- **Inhabitable prose output**: Generated souls read naturally, not as compressed notation
- **Cognitive load optimization**: Axioms capped at 25, expanded into focused prose sections

---

## Why Provenance Matters

```
Memory Line → Signal → Principle → Axiom
     ↓           ↓          ↓          ↓
 (source)    (extract)   (distill)  (converge N≥3)
```

Every axiom traces to source:
- **Audit**: Why does this axiom exist?
- **Debug**: Where did this belief come from?
- **Trust**: Transparent identity formation
- **Rollback**: Undo specific learnings granularly

```bash
$ /neon-soul audit ax_honesty

Axiom: 誠 (honesty > performance)
Status: Core axiom (N=5)

Provenance chain:
├── Principle: "Prioritize honesty over comfort"
│   └── Signal: "be honest even if uncomfortable" (memory/2026-02-01.md:156)
├── Principle: "Direct communication preferred"
│   └── Signal: "don't sugarcoat" (memory/2026-02-03.md:89)
└── ...
```

---

## Grounding Requirements (Anti-Echo-Chamber Protection)

NEON-SOUL prevents self-reinforcing beliefs through provenance-aware axiom promotion:

- **Minimum pattern**: Axioms require N≥3 supporting principles
- **Diversity requirement**: Signals from ≥2 distinct provenance types (self/curated/external)
- **External validation**: At least one external source OR questioning evidence required

Blocked axioms are reported with their reason:
```
⚠ 2 axioms blocked by anti-echo-chamber:
  - "I value authenticity above all" (self-only provenance)
  - "Growth requires discomfort" (no questioning evidence)
```

To unblock, add external validation (feedback, research, critique) to your memory.

---

## Cycle Management

Synthesis adapts based on how much has changed:

| Mode | When | Behavior |
|------|------|----------|
| **initial** | First synthesis | Full synthesis from scratch |
| **incremental** | <30% new principles | Merge insights efficiently |
| **full-resynthesis** | Major changes | Complete rebuild |

Full resynthesis triggers automatically when:
- New principle ratio ≥30%
- Contradictions detected (≥2)
- Hierarchy structure changed

Manual trigger: `--force-resynthesis` flag.

---

## Vision

NEON-SOUL explores how to create compressed soul documents that maintain full semantic anchoring - enabling AI systems to "wake up knowing who they are" with minimal token overhead.

*Note: Current compression metrics show signal:axiom ratio. True token compression requires dedicated tokenization (planned for Phase 5).*

---

## Synthesis Metrics

Each synthesis reports detailed metrics:

```
Synthesis Complete
─────────────────────
Duration: 1,234ms
Compression: 6.2:1

Results:
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Signals | 42 |
| Principles | 18 |
| Axioms | 7 |
| Unconverged | 3 |

Provenance Distribution:
| Type | Count |
|------|-------|
| self | 28 |
| curated | 10 |
| external | 4 |

Axiom Promotion:
| Status | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Promotable | 5 |
| Blocked | 2 |
```

Metrics include:
- **Compression ratio**: Signals to axioms (higher = more compression)
- **Provenance distribution**: Signal sources by type
- **Promotion stats**: How many axioms met anti-echo-chamber criteria

---

## Research Questions

1. **Compression limits**: How compressed can a soul be before losing identity coherence?
2. **Semantic anchoring**: Do CJK-compressed souls anchor as well as verbose ones?
3. **Universal axioms**: Are there ~100 principles any AI soul needs?
4. **Cross-model portability**: Can the same soul work across different LLMs?
5. **Evolution mechanics**: How should souls change over time?

---

## Background

### The Problem

Current soul document implementations (e.g., OpenClaw) inject ~35,000 tokens per message for identity. This wastes 93%+ of context window on static content.

### The Hypothesis

Using semantic compression techniques from NEON-AI research:
- CJK single-character axioms
- Semantic richness validation (Phase 1 methodology)
- Hierarchical principle expansion
- **Provenance-first extraction** (full audit trail)

...we can achieve 6-10x compression while maintaining identity coherence AND providing full transparency into how identity forms.

### The Approach

**Single-track replacement** (OpenClaw SOUL.md is read-only after bootstrap):
- Initial SOUL.md serves as first memory file for bootstrap
- NEON-SOUL generates new compressed SOUL.md with full provenance
- Memory ingestion pipeline adds signals over time
- Output replaces original (with backup and rollback capability)

---

## Technology

**Stack**: Node.js + TypeScript (native OpenClaw integration)

**Architecture**: NEON-SOUL is implemented as an **OpenClaw skill**, not a standalone CLI:
- Uses OpenClaw's authenticated LLM access (no separate API key)
- Invoked via `/neon-soul` skill commands or scheduled via OpenClaw cron
- LLM-based semantic similarity (no third-party npm packages)
- Native access to OpenClaw memory system

**Why TypeScript**: OpenClaw is built in TypeScript/Node.js. Using the same stack provides:
- Same runtime (Node.js already installed)
- Native skill integration
- Potential upstream contribution

**UX**: Chat-native (Telegram/Discord/Slack) via OpenClaw skill integration, not a separate web app.

## Installation

### Claude Code / Gemini CLI / Cursor

```bash
git clone https://github.com/geeks-accelerator/neon-soul
cp -r neon-soul/skill ~/.claude/skills/neon-soul
```

The skill becomes available as `/neon-soul` commands.

### OpenClaw

```bash
clawhub install leegitw/neon-soul
```

Skills install to `./skills/` and OpenClaw loads them automatically.

### Via npm (for OpenClaw skill developers)

> **Note**: The npm package requires an LLM provider context from OpenClaw.
> It will throw `LLMRequiredError` if used standalone.
> For standalone use, wait for v0.2.0 which will include Ollama fallback.

```bash
npm install neon-soul
```

### Any LLM Agent (Copy/Paste)

Open `skill/SKILL.md` on GitHub, copy contents, paste directly into your agent's chat.

---

## Your First 5 Minutes

After installing, try these commands:

1. `/neon-soul status` - See your current state
2. `/neon-soul synthesize --dry-run` - Preview synthesis (no changes)
3. `/neon-soul synthesize --force` - Run synthesis when ready
4. `/neon-soul audit --list` - Explore what was created
5. `/neon-soul trace <axiom-id>` - See provenance for any axiom

---

## Development Setup

**Requirements**: Node.js 22+

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd neon-soul
npm install

# Build
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Type check (no emit)
npm run lint
```

**Note**: Requires an active LLM connection (Claude Code, OpenClaw, or compatible agent).

---

## Getting Started

**5-minute onboarding** - from install to first synthesis:

### 1. Install (Prerequisites)

```bash
# Requires: Node.js 22+, OpenClaw installed
cd neon-soul
npm install && npm run build
```

### 2. Check Current State

```bash
/neon-soul status
# Output:
# Last Synthesis: never (first run)
# Pending Memory: 12,345 chars (Ready for synthesis)
# Counts: 0 signals, 0 principles, 0 axioms
```

### 3. Preview Changes (Dry Run)

```bash
/neon-soul synthesize --dry-run
# Shows what would change without writing
# Safe to run anytime
```

### 4. Run Synthesis

```bash
/neon-soul synthesize --force
# Extracts signals from memory
# Promotes principles to axioms (N≥3)
# Generates new SOUL.md with provenance
```

### 5. Explore What Was Created

```bash
/neon-soul audit --stats       # Overview by tier and dimension
/neon-soul audit --list        # List all axioms
/neon-soul trace ax_honesty    # Quick provenance lookup
```

### 6. Rollback If Needed

```bash
/neon-soul rollback --list     # Show available backups
/neon-soul rollback --force    # Restore most recent backup
```

**Note**: All commands support `--workspace <path>` for non-default workspaces.
